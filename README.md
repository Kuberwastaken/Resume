# Kuber Mehta's Resume

This repository serves as a version-controlled system for my professional resume. By treating my resume as a project in Git, I am able to maintain a history of changes, ensuring that the most up-to-date version is always available. Each time I make updates or revisions to my resume, I simply commit and push the changes to this repository. This allows me to have a consistent and automated way of managing and sharing my resume.

In addition, this repository is connected to a website that hosts my latest resume. By using GitHub Pages, I can ensure that the resume is accessible via a public URL, eliminating the need to manually upload it to other platforms or update multiple copies across different services. This also ensures that my resume is always current without needing to make manual changes in multiple locations.

The setup here provides a seamless experience for me to share my resume with anyone, anywhere. Any time I update or revise my resume, I push the changes, and the website instantly reflects those updates. This process keeps my resume consistent and up-to-date, while automating the tedious task of managing multiple versions.
